    <h1>The Symptoms of Depression</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      Depression is clinically defined by a cluster of symptoms that persist for at least 
      two weeks. But the clinical list does not capture what these symptoms actually 
      <em>feel like</em> from the inside — or how dramatically they differ from the 
      everyday ups and downs that everyone experiences.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- ── Core Symptoms ── -->
  <div class="section fade-in">
    <h2>Core Symptoms at a Glance</h2>
    <p>
      The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) identifies nine 
      core symptoms. A diagnosis requires five or more to be present during the same 
      two-week period, with at least one being depressed mood or loss of interest. 
      Below, we focus on the symptoms most relevant to daily functioning.
    </p>

    <div class="card-grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Persistent Low Mood</h3>
        <p>
          Not ordinary sadness triggered by an event, but a pervasive heaviness that 
          persists regardless of circumstances. Many describe it as a weight on the chest 
          or a gray filter over everything. It does not resolve with good news or enjoyable 
          activities.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Anhedonia</h3>
        <p>
          The inability to experience pleasure from activities that were once enjoyable. 
          This is not boredom — it is the brain's reward system failing to activate. Food 
          tastes bland, hobbies feel pointless, social interactions produce no warmth.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Fatigue &amp; Energy Loss</h3>
        <p>
          A bone-deep exhaustion that is not proportional to physical activity. Someone 
          can sleep ten hours and wake feeling as though they haven't rested at all. 
          Simple tasks like showering or cooking can feel like monumental efforts.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Cognitive Impairment</h3>
        <p>
          Difficulty concentrating, making decisions, and holding information in working 
          memory. Research shows measurable deficits in executive function, processing 
          speed, and attention during depressive episodes (Rock et al., 2014).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Sleep Disruption</h3>
        <p>
          Either insomnia (difficulty falling or staying asleep) or hypersomnia (sleeping 
          excessively but never feeling rested). The disruption to circadian rhythm 
          compounds every other symptom.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Worthlessness &amp; Guilt</h3>
        <p>
          Excessive, often irrational guilt and a deep sense of being fundamentally 
          inadequate. This is not low self-esteem — it is a cognitive distortion 
          generated by the condition itself, making the person believe they are a burden.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- ── How It Differs ── -->
  <div class="section fade-in">
    <h2>How It Differs from Typical Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Everyone has bad days. The crucial difference is in <strong>duration</strong>, 
      <strong>intensity</strong>, and <strong>controllability</strong>. The comparisons 
      below illustrate this distinction.
    </p>

    <h3>Feeling Tired</h3>
    <div class="comparison">
      <div class="typical">
        <div class="label">Typical Experience</div>
        <p>
          After a long day, you feel tired. A good night's sleep, a coffee, or a short 
          break restores your energy. The tiredness makes sense — it tracks effort.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="depression">
        <div class="label">During Depression</div>
        <p>
          You wake exhausted after nine hours of sleep. Your body feels heavy. Getting 
          dressed requires deliberate effort. The fatigue has no clear cause and no 
          clear remedy. Rest does not help.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Losing Interest</h3>
    <div class="comparison">
      <div class="typical">
        <div class="label">Typical Experience</div>
        <p>
          You go through phases — some weeks you're into gaming, then you shift to 
          reading. Interests evolve, but pleasure itself remains accessible. You can 
          usually find <em>something</em> enjoyable.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="depression">
        <div class="label">During Depression</div>
        <p>
          Nothing produces pleasure. You know intellectually that you used to enjoy 
          music, cooking, or seeing friends, but engaging with them now feels empty. 
          It is not that you chose to stop caring — the capacity for enjoyment has 
          gone offline.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Difficulty Concentrating</h3>
    <div class="comparison">
      <div class="typical">
        <div class="label">Typical Experience</div>
        <p>
          Distraction is common — you check your phone, your mind wanders in a meeting. 
          But when something is important or interesting enough, you can usually focus 
          and complete the task.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="depression">
        <div class="label">During Depression</div>
        <p>
          Even high-stakes tasks cannot hold your attention. You read the same paragraph 
          five times. You sit at your desk for an hour and produce nothing. The effort 
          to concentrate is itself exhausting. Research shows this reflects measurable 
          deficits in working memory and executive function (Snyder, 2013).
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Feeling Guilty</h3>
    <div class="comparison">
      <div class="typical">
        <div class="label">Typical Experience</div>
        <p>
          Guilt follows specific actions — you said something hurtful, missed a deadline, 
          forgot a birthday. The guilt is proportional, and it fades as you address 
          the situation.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="depression">
        <div class="label">During Depression</div>
        <p>
          Guilt is constant and disproportionate. You feel guilty for existing, for 
          being a burden, for not being productive enough — even when no one has 
          criticized you. The guilt becomes its own evidence: "I feel this bad, so 
          I must deserve it."
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- ── The Invisible Burden ── -->
  <div class="section fade-in">
    <h2>The Invisible Burden</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most isolating aspects of depression is its invisibility. Unlike a 
      broken leg or a fever, depression has no outward markers that reliably signal 
      its presence. People with depression often become skilled at "masking" — 
      performing normalcy in social situations while internally struggling with every 
      interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      This invisibility creates a paradox: the better someone masks, the less support 
      they receive, because others assume they are fine. High-functioning depression — 
      where someone continues to work, attend classes, and socialize while internally 
      experiencing significant symptoms — is particularly prone to being dismissed or 
      overlooked.
    </p>

    <div class="callout fade-in">
      <p>
        <strong>Key insight:</strong> When someone with depression says "I'm fine," it 
        often means "I don't have the energy to explain what I'm actually experiencing, 
        and I'm not sure you would understand if I did." The social cost of honesty — 
        potential pity, discomfort, unsolicited advice — often exceeds the benefit.
