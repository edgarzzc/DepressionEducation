    <h1>How Depression Reshapes Daily Life</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      Depression does not just affect how someone feels — it alters how they 
      <em>function</em>. Below, we walk through four common daily tasks and show 
      how depression transforms each one from a manageable activity into a 
      significant cognitive and emotional challenge.

    <h2>Job Interviews</h2>

    <div class="scenario">
      <div class="scenario-title">The Setting</div>
      <p class="scenario-context">
        A 25-year-old recent graduate prepares for a job interview at a company 
        they applied to weeks ago. The interview is tomorrow morning.
      </p>
    </div>

        <p>
          Nervous but functional. You research the company, rehearse answers, pick 
          an outfit. The nervousness sharpens focus — your sympathetic nervous 
          system provides a productive level of arousal. During the interview, 
          adrenaline helps you think on your feet.

        <p>
          Preparation feels impossible. The cognitive fog makes it hard to organize 
          thoughts or recall accomplishments. Worthlessness distorts self-assessment: 
          "Why would they hire me?" replaces preparation. During the interview, 
          working memory deficits make it difficult to track multi-part questions. 
          Flat affect and psychomotor slowing can be misread as disinterest.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="callout fade-in">
      <p>
        <strong>Research context:</strong> Studies show that depression significantly 
        impairs verbal fluency and cognitive flexibility — both critical for interview 
        performance. A meta-analysis by Semkovska et al. (2019) found that even after 
        remission, some cognitive deficits can persist, meaning the impact extends 
        beyond active episodes.

          "This candidate seems unprepared and low-energy. They gave vague answers

          The candidate spent three hours trying to prepare but couldn't retain 
          information. They are intensely interested in the role — it represents 
          hope — but the cognitive and emotional symptoms of their condition made 
          it nearly impossible to demonstrate competence.

      <p class="scenario-context">
        It is 11 PM. Tomorrow is a normal weekday. The person has been in bed

          You might think about the day briefly, maybe scroll your phone for a few 
          minutes, then drift off. If stressed, falling asleep might take longer, 
          but sleep eventually comes. You wake feeling reasonably rested.

        <p>
          The quiet of bedtime amplifies rumination. The mind cycles through failures, 
          regrets, and fears on an automatic loop that cannot be interrupted by 
          willpower. When sleep finally comes, it is fragmented — waking at 3 AM is 
          common (early morning awakening is a hallmark of melancholic depression). 
          Alternatively, hypersomnia pulls you into 12+ hours of sleep that provides 
          no restoration.

        <strong>Research context:</strong> Rumination — the repetitive, passive focus 
        on distressing thoughts — is one of the strongest cognitive predictors of 
        depression severity and duration (Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008). Neuroimaging 
        studies show that the default mode network (DMN), which is active during 
        self-referential thought, is hyperactive in depressed individuals, 
        particularly during rest (Hamilton et al., 2015).

        A college student receives a text from a classmate inviting them to a

          You evaluate logistics — do you have time, do you want to go? Maybe you're 
          a bit tired but think it'll be fun. You go, make small talk, and leave 
          feeling connected. If you don't go, you don't feel guilty about it for days.

      <div class="depression">

        <p>
          The invitation triggers a cascade: wanting to go (loneliness is painful) 
          but dreading the energy it requires (anhedonia strips the expected reward). 
          Social anxiety amplifies — "What if I bring everyone down?" Self-worth 
          distortions add: "They probably invited me out of obligation." If they go, 
          masking is exhausting. If they don't, guilt and isolation deepen.

          <p>
            The energy cost of socializing begins to outweigh the expected pleasure. 
            Anhedonia means that even successful social interactions don't produce the 
            dopamine reward that reinforces social behavior. Invitations are declined 
            not out of dislike for the people, but because the brain's cost-benefit 
            calculation has been altered by the condition.

            Friends notice the distance. Some reach out; some don't. The person with 
            depression interprets the lack of contact as confirmation of their fear: 
            "No one actually cares." Meanwhile, responding to messages feels like an 
            impossible cognitive task — composing a text can take thirty minutes of 
            deliberation about what to say and whether it sounds normal enough.

            Social isolation becomes self-reinforcing. The longer someone is withdrawn, 
            the more anxious re-engagement becomes. The absence of social interaction 
            removes one of the few remaining sources of positive stimulation, deepening 
            anhedonia. Loneliness itself activates stress responses that worsen depressive 
            symptoms (Cacioppo et al., 2015).

    <div class="scenario">
      <div class="scenario-title">The Setting</div>
      <p class="scenario-context">
        A student needs to study for a midterm exam in three days. The material 
        requires reading, comprehension, and memorization of complex concepts.

        <p>
          Studying isn't always enjoyable, but it's doable. You break the material 
          into sections, take notes, test yourself. Concentration fluctuates but can 
          be managed with breaks. After a study session, you feel progress.

        <p>
          Opening the textbook requires overcoming a wall of inertia. Reading is slow — 
          sentences need to be re-read multiple times because working memory can't hold 
          the information. Notes don't stick. After two hours, almost nothing has been 
          retained. The failure to study becomes evidence of personal inadequacy: 
          "Everyone else can do this — what is wrong with me?"

      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Cognitive Costs in Detail</h3>
    <div class="card-grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Working Memory</h3>
        <p>
          Depression reduces working memory capacity — the mental "workspace" where 
          information is temporarily held and manipulated. This is why reading 
          comprehension drops: by the time you finish a paragraph, the beginning 
          has faded.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Executive Function</h3>
        <p>
          Planning, task-switching, and prioritizing all fall under executive function, 
          which is significantly impaired during depression. Creating a study schedule 
          and sticking to it requires exactly the cognitive resources the condition 
          depletes.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Motivation System</h3>
        <p>
          In a healthy brain, dopamine anticipation ("I'll feel good after I finish 
          this chapter") drives effort. Depression blunts this anticipatory reward 
          signal. The future state of "having studied" doesn't generate enough 
          motivational pull to overcome the present-moment inertia.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="callout red fade-in">
      <p>
        <strong>The self-blame trap:</strong> Because cognitive impairment is invisible 
        and poorly understood, many students with depression blame themselves for poor 
        academic performance rather than recognizing it as a symptom of their condition. 
        This self-blame reinforces feelings of worthlessness, creating a feedback loop 
        that deepens the depressive episode.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section fade-in">
    <h2>The Common Thread</h2>
    <p>
      Across all four scenarios, the pattern is the same: depression disrupts the 
      brain's core systems for motivation, reward, attention, and emotional regulation. 
      These are not separate problems — they are interconnected symptoms of a single 
      condition affecting how the brain allocates cognitive resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding this is important because it reframes the conversation. The question 
      shifts from "Why can't they just try harder?" to "What systems are impaired, and 
      how can support be designed around those impairments?" The next sections explore 
      the biological and psychological mechanisms behind these effects.
