    <h1>Depression Is Not What<br>Most People <em>Think</em> It Is</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      It is not sadness. It is not weakness. It is a condition that reshapes how 
      the brain processes motivation, reward, attention, and sleep — making 
      everyday life profoundly harder than it looks from the outside.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Project Exists</h2>
    <p>
      Depression affects over 280 million people worldwide, yet it remains one of the most 
      misunderstood conditions in daily conversation. People often reduce it to "feeling sad" 
      or assume that motivation and willpower can override it. This misunderstanding creates 
      a gap — between what someone with depression actually experiences and what the people 
      around them believe is happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project exists to close that gap. Through five interconnected pages, we explore 
      how depression manifests as specific, measurable symptoms; how those symptoms make 
      ordinary tasks like studying, interviewing for jobs, sleeping, and maintaining 
      friendships extraordinarily difficult; and what the biological and psychological 
      research actually tells us about <em>why</em> these difficulties occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is not to diagnose or treat, but to build genuine understanding — so that 
      the next time you interact with someone experiencing depression, your response comes 
      from knowledge rather than assumption.

        <h3>The Symptoms</h3>
        <p>
          How depression symptoms go far beyond sadness — affecting energy, concentration, 
          perception of self, and the ability to feel pleasure — and how these experiences 
          differ from what typical individuals feel day to day.

        <h3>Daily Life Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Concrete scenarios showing how depression makes interviews, sleep, friendships, 
          and focused studying not just harder, but fundamentally different from the same 
          activities experienced by someone without the condition.

        <h3>The Science Behind It</h3>
        <p>
          The biological mechanisms — from neurotransmitter disruption to HPA axis 
          dysregulation — and the psychological frameworks that explain why these symptoms 
          emerge. Depression is a medical condition, not a character flaw.

        <h3>How to Help</h3>
        <p>
          Practical guidance on how to support someone with depression without 
          accidentally causing more harm — because well-intentioned advice can sometimes 
          deepen the pain.

    <h2>A Note on Language</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout this project, we deliberately avoid framing depression as a disability 
      or defining people by their condition. People experiencing depression are not 
      fundamentally different from anyone else — they are dealing with a condition that 
      alters how their brain and body function in ways that are now well-documented 
      by neuroscience and psychology.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we compare "typical experience" with "experience during depression," we are 
      describing the effect of a condition on cognition and behavior — not drawing a 
      line between two kinds of people. Anyone can develop depression. Understanding it 
      is understanding something about being human.
